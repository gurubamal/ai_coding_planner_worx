        "Reduce S7 scope: Instead of 'create documentation', simply verify autostart works and note the Plex server address - removes 5-8 minutes of non-essential work",

Main weaknesses are late validation timing and potential time waste if prerequisites aren't met. However, the Plex + VR player approach is industry-standard and likely to succeed.
