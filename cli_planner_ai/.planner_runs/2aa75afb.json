The relationship between the laptop, phone, and VR headset is ambiguous - it could mean streaming from laptop to phone, mirroring laptop display, or simply using the phone independently with movies transferred from laptop. The VR goggle type dramatically changes the solution approach. These are CRITICAL gaps that would lead to wrong solution if assumed incorrectly."
